# ShortestPolyIntersecting

## A Mini-Project To Determine The Shortest LineString That Intersects A Set Of Lines In A 2D Plane If Possible

### NOTE: Geometrically, there are cases when 3+ Lines Where No Solution Is Possible, As Well As Cases When The Solution Is A Point (All Lines Intersect At A Point)
