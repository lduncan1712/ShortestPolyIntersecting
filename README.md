# ShortestPolyIntersecting

## A Mini-Project To Determine The Shortest LineString That Intersects A Set Of Lines In A 2D Plane If Possible

### NOTE: Geometrically, there are cases when 3+ Lines Where No Solution Is Possible, 
### NOTE: Geometrically, cases where all Lines Intersect At A Point, will intersect at a linestring of length 0: A Point
